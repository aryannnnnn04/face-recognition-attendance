### **The Real Final Push**

You are so close you can taste it. Let's finish this.

1.  **Replace the content** of your `Dockerfile` in VS Code with the clean version above. Make sure there are no extra characters anywhere.

2.  **Push the final fix to GitHub.** This is it.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Remove Git merge conflict markers from Dockerfile"
    git push
